# SmartShift

### Purpose
A cross-platform mobile productivity app developed with React Native and Expo; it is centered around the Pomodoro Method and the Eisenhower Matrix (Urgency-Importance). Users can have their own Pomodoro Timer which they can customize themselves in order to find a good work-to-break time ratio. Additionally, user's can organize their tasks in an interactive task list that allows users to prioritize their tasks based on urgency and importance. User's will also get notifications for upcoming task deadlines. Lastly, user's will be able to write and view reflections for all their working periods, and set daily goals for themselves that updates automatically. We have a fully functional backend that allows users to access their data from any device by using their same account.
